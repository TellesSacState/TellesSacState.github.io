    <h1>Art Exhibit I Went To</h1>
    <p>
        Over the winter break I went to <strong>Washington</strong> to visit a friend for a few weeks.
        I was staying about 40 minutes north of Portland, Oregon; in a the city of <strong>Longview</strong>.
        While I was in Washington, I went to <a href="https://omsi.edu/">OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science Institution)</a>. 
        There was this temporary exhibit full of some spectacular bugs and other creatures. 
        Each piece within the exhibit was an artistic display of all kinds of animals and plants, and my mind was absolutely blown when I saw each piece.
        There were some crazy animals like <strong>metallic colored beetles</strong>, <strong>vibrant butterflies</strong>, <strong>huge bugs</strong>, and <strong>mind bending camoflage sea creatures</strong>.
